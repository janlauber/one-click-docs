# ðŸ“‚ Projects

In One-Click you can create a new project or manage existing ones. Each project will get a unique `ID` which will be used to identify the project inside the Kubernetes cluster. The project will also get a unique `namespace` in the Kubernetes cluster which has the same name as the project `ID`.

## Create a new project

To create a new project, log in to the One-Click platform and click on the top right corner `New Project` button. Fill in the project name and description and select a `blueprint` to use for the project. Click on the `Create project` button to create the project.

{% hint style="info" %}
You first need to create a blueprint before you can create a project. Head over to the [blueprints.md](blueprints.md "mention") section to learn more about blueprints.
{% endhint %}

You can also set some labels for the project. Labels are used to group projects together and can be used to filter projects in the project list.

## Manage existing projects

Each project has it's own overview page where you can see the details of the project and it's resources.

There will be a Kubernetes namespace each One-Click project with certain labels:

| label                             | description                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| project.one-click.dev/displayName | The users display name in pocketbase. |
| project.one-click.dev/name        | The project name which is the ID.     |
| project.one-click.dev/userId      | The users ID of the project.          |
| project.one-click.dev/username    | The username of the project.          |

### Overview

In the project overview, you can see the counts of: rollouts, instances, interfaces, volumes, envs and secrets. You can also see the current container image. There is also a cpu and memory usage graph for the project.

### Project settings

In the project settings, you can change the project **name**, **description**, and **labels**. You can also **delete** the project from the project settings. There is also an option to use _advanced editing_ mode for the project. Head over to the [crd.md](../operator-manual/crd.md "mention") section to learn more about the Operator CRD. You can also directly create a new **blueprint** from the selected project.

#### Project settings

In the project settings, you can change the project name, description, and labels. You can also delete the project from the project settings which will also delete the namespace in the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Advanced editing

With advanced editing, you can add settings to the project that are not available in the UI. You can also see the raw CRD of the project.

#### New blueprint from project

With a new blueprint from the project, you can create a new blueprint with the same settings as the project. The only thing which is not copied are the ingress settings.
