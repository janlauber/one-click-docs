# Overview

In One-Click you can create a new project or manage existing ones. Each project will get a unique `ID` which will be used to identify the project inside the Kubernetes cluster. The project will also get a unique `namespace` in the Kubernetes cluster which has the same name as the project `ID`.

## Create a new project

To create a new project, log in to the One-Click platform and click on the top right corner `New Project` button. Fill in the project name and description and select a `blueprint` to use for the project. Click on the `Create project` button to create the project.

You first need to create a blueprint before you can create a project. Head over to the [blueprints.md](../blueprints.md "mention") section to learn more about blueprints.
