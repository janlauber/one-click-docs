# ðŸ“ƒ Blueprints

Blueprints are stored configurations of a One-Click [CRD](../operator-manual/crd.md). With these blueprints you can easily bootstrap new projects with no effort. The use cases are for example to predifine some enhanced configurations in your rollout crd yaml file which then get automatically applied when creating a new project out of this blueprint.

### Overview

After you are logged into your One-Click account you can see the Blueprints button. When you click on this button you will get navigated to the blueprints overview page.

On this overview page you see your blueprints and also the one's from your community. These are blueprints other users in the same One-Click instance shared with you through a link.

When you click on the 3 dots of a blueprint you can "edit", "share" or "delete" the selected blueprint.

{% hint style="info" %}
The little **lock** icon indicates, that this blueprint is private and cannot get added from other users through the link:\

You can also make your blue print public and after your user added it you can make it private and the user still has access.
{% endhint %}

### Sharing blueprints

When clicking on "share" in the action menu of a certain blueprint you will get a custom link:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>share blueprint</p></figcaption></figure>

Another user will get the following action when visiting the link:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>add to blueprints</p></figcaption></figure>

He can also "unsubscribe" the blueprint again:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>unsubscribe</p></figcaption></figure>

The user who shared his blueprint sees now the Shared count increasing and when hovering over the number he sees the users which added his blueprint:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>shared</p></figcaption></figure>

### Creating / Editing blueprints

You can easily create new blueprints by clicking on the "New Blueprint" button.

Only the owner of the blueprint can edit it again:
